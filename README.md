# :firecracker: :sparkles: Fireworks :fireworks: :sparkler:
A New Year's countdown application that also features a fireworks show using Unity's Particle System.

This application can be compiled deployed on other systems including but not limited to Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, XBOX Series, WebGL but is not gaurenteed to do so and is provided "AS-IS" with no warranties.

Try out my WebGL build at http://bangera.io/newyear/

Exit the application with Alt+F4 (Windows), CMD + Q (MacOSX)


## Some TODOs if I ever get to it
* Simulated Particle System using PhysX. 
* Expanded UI Customizations
* Documentations
* Screen calibrations and responsive UI/UX. 


#### HAPPY NEW YEAR 2020
